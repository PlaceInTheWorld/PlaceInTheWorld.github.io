                    My time in El Nido didn’t start off great — I got food poisoning and spent days recovering. But that downtime gave me space to think about work, gap year, and what I actually want from the next phase of life. This post is less about travel and more about trying to make sense of what comes next.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The more I think about it, the more I realize that I simply don’t want to go to work in September.<br>But I might be forced.<br><br>It all started in El Nido. Our trip to the Philippines has been transformative. I got a really bad case of food poisoning, and it took me over a week to recover. The first few days, I had no energy at all and I barely remember how they passed. But gradually, I started feeling better, and eventually, I even found a new sense of motivation to be productive.<br><br>I started thinking about what my next step is going to be. I had planned to take a gap year and then enroll in university in September and start working to support myself. But being in El Nido, on a backpacking route exploring the world, made me want to ditch university and just continue traveling.<br><br>But, despite what TikTok and Instagram might present to you, traveling costs money. You can go through your savings pretty quickly and if you’re not careful, you’ll end up in a dangerous place (where you might have to switch from morning coffee with avocado toast to a glass of water with toasted bread). And even if you are careful, you give yourself some extra days (or weeks) but eventually, you have to start considering getting a job to pay for all these adventures.<br><br>So here’s where my struggle starts. Deep down (very deep down) I do want to come back to Europe, finish university and see what life has to offer next. But&nbsp; I don’t want to get a job.<br><br>Maybe I just never had a great experience at work or maybe it was just the type of jobs that I was applying to, but I’ve never really liked it. I spent most of my time mind-training to see the good side of the work that I was doing, I was really trying not to complain or to even think too deeply about what I’m spending my days on, the mental effort that I was putting in was some serious magic. And the money was mostly pretty good. So that always got me a rush of motivation to start a new Monday.<br><br>But I never enjoyed being told when to wake up, how to do simple things, being bossed around by a manager on their “bad day,” it was exhausting. And I was exhausted by putting so much of my energy into keeping my calm.<br></p>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-10">
                
                
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Maybe I should aim higher – apply to jobs that would really use my skills that I’ve been building, in university and outside. But my problem is that I can’t sell myself (please tell me I’m not the only one). I have a guilty conscience when I imagine exaggerating on my CV or pretending to know how to do things. I feel like I have no real experience at a normal job and don’t know how to pinpoint what I’d learnt in my Orderpicker position, other than “How not to lose my mind with a crazy boss.” I should actually maybe look into the skill of building a CV. I have to write a proper CV for myself.
<br>
<br>Nevertheless, I don’t want to go back to that life. My gap year is supposed to end in September and I should enroll in university and get a job to pay for my expenses. While recovering from my food poisoning, I started looking for a job online—something I could do remotely or maybe once I arrived home in Europe. I found a few listings that seemed okay and saved them to my “liked options.” But I didn’t really like them.
<br>
<br>The jobs that sounded even somewhat interesting were out of my reach because I didn’t have the qualifications or experience - hopefully University will help with that. And the ones I could potentially do seemed really boring to me. El Nido made me think that I might not <em>have to</em> get a normal job. Walking by the beach heading to the most chaotic and vibrant city, I felt inspired and motivated to make income with something I love.
<br>
<br>This might be a good intro for launching a brand new product, unfortunately, that is not happening. But it is the sort of direction I want to be heading towards.
<br>
<br>I understand that sometimes we need to do things we don’t like (jobs that pay the bills) in order to do the things we love (travel, read, create). But I don’t feel like this next year is meant to be about survival for me. I want to try working on a few ideas I’ve come up with, to see if I can start making money doing something I actually care about.
<br>
<br>I only have a few more days in the Philippines, but I have about four more months of my gap year to make things work. If it all goes badly, I can just go back to a regular job in September like nothing happened.
<br>
<br>So that’s what El Nido was for me. Mostly, it was about recovering from food poisoning — but also visiting the beach, exploring the town and having a lot of fun adventures. At the same time, I spent hours reflecting on my projects, trying to put into words and plans the things that I enjoy and that bring me happiness — and maybe could bring in some income too.
<br>
<br>I'm going to try and document this journey and hopefully by the time university starts, I can look back and see that I have come a long way.<br></p>
